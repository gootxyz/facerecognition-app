# facerecognition-app

This full-stack web application allows users to identify a face in different image routes by the ClarifaiÂ´s face-detection model (https://clarifai.com/clarifai/main/models/face-detection).

The React app allows users to register, log-in, and log-out while storing their own number of detected faces wihtin the application.

This project utilizes React in the frontend (Vercel hosted), Node and Express to handle the server and backend, and stores the data in a Postgres database (Railway hosted).
